iContas 2.0.1

This is a Personal Finance Software developed using MEAN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js and Node.js)
The intent of this software was purely for my own use. However, after using it for quite some time, I decided to share it with the public via github.
Feel free to contribute.
Sorry for not having other locales yet. I've started only using pt-BR. Will migrate later on.

# Database
Make sure you have installed MongoDB.
Check the file `server/api/models/db.js` for details about the connection to the database.
I don't have a dummy database for testing yet. I'm using my own real stuff. But as soon as you run the application, it will create the collections and have all set for you to start adding stuff.

Enjoy!!

# Server

This project was generated with Node.js
Run `npm install && npm start` to run the server.

# Client

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.7. Then migrated to Angular 12.0.0
Run `npm install && npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
